### Checklist

For adding novel benchmarks/datasets to the library:

- [x] Is the task an existing benchmark in the literature?
  - [x] Have you referenced the original paper that introduced the task?
  - [x] If yes, does the original paper provide a reference implementation? If so, have you checked against the reference implementation and documented how to run such a test?

If other tasks on this dataset are already supported:

- [x] Is the "Main" variant of this task clearly denoted?
- [x] Have you provided a short sentence in a README on what each new variant adds / evaluates?
- [x] Have you noted which, if any, published evaluation setups are matched by this variant?
