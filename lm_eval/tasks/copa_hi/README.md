Title: IndicNLPSuite: Monolingual Corpora, Evaluation Benchmarks and Pre-trained Multilingual Language Models for Indian Languages

Abstract: https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.445.pdf

Choice of Plausible Alternatives (COPA): tests open-domain causal reasoning. Given a premise, models must identify the more plausible cause or effect from two alternatives, requiring an understanding of causal relationships. This dataset is available in other Indian languages as well, but this implementation is only for Hindi.

#### Tasks

* copa_hi: Given a premise, models must identify the more plausible cause or effect from two alternatives, requiring an understanding of causal relationships.


### Checklist

For adding novel benchmarks/datasets to the library:

* [x] Is the task an existing benchmark in the literature?
  * [x] Have you referenced the original paper that introduced the task?
  * [x] If yes, does the original paper provide a reference implementation? If so, have you checked against the reference implementation and documented how to run such a test?

If other tasks on this dataset are already supported:

* [ ] Is the "Main" variant of this task clearly denoted?
* [ ] Have you provided a short sentence in a README on what each new variant adds / evaluates?
* [ ] Have you noted which, if any, published evaluation setups are matched by this variant?
